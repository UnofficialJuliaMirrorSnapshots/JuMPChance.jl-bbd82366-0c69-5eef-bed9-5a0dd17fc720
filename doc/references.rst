One of the first appearances of the convex reformulation discussed in the previous section was in 1958 by `Charnes, Cooper, and Symonds <http://www.jstor.org/stable/2627328>`_, subsequently studied by `Pr√©kopa (1970) <http://rutcor.rutgers.edu/~prekopa/prob.pdf>`_ and others. It now appears in standard texts on stochastic programming. The field of chance constraints is quite broad, and a discussion of formulations which are not implemented here is beyond the scope of this document.

The class of distributionally robust chance constraints considered is a special case of so-called robust second-order conic optimization. Tractability is discussed by `Ben-Tal, El Ghaoui, and Nemirovski (2009) <http://www2.isye.gatech.edu/~nemirovs/FullBookDec11.pdf>`_. The particular model was proposed by `Bienstock, Chertkov, and Harnett (2014) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/130910312>`_ with application to control of power systems under uncertainty.

JuMPChance is being used in ongoing research projects and reports which are currently in preparation.
